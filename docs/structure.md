## Structure (human area - don't touch)

I will have the following areas of content:
- SLides- what i use to present in the lectures
- Modules - each module is one days lectures (3.5 hours) - the student needs descriptions, what to read etc.
- Web - other pages that do not fit in the first two categories
 - e.g. Course background, finals, literature, etc.

## AI can fil in the rest of the setup here
